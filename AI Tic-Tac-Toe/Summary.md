# AI Tic-Tac-Toe

I developed an AI-powered Tic-Tac-Toe game that is unbeatable. The game offers flexibility in choosing the players, allowing the user to select the type of opponent for both X and O players:

1. **Human**: Play against another human player.
2. **Dumb Computer**: An AI that makes random moves without strategic planning.
3. **Smart Computer**: An advanced AI that employs optimal strategies to ensure it never loses. The best outcome a player can achieve against the smart computer is a tie.

The smart computer's algorithm is based on the minimax strategy, which evaluates all possible moves and their consequences to select the best possible action. This ensures that the smart computer always makes the optimal move, making it impossible to defeat.

By offering different levels of AI difficulty and allowing customization of both players, this Tic-Tac-Toe game provides a versatile and engaging experience that showcases the capabilities of AI in strategic gameplay.
