# Movie Recommendation System

I developed a movie recommendation system utilizing K-Neighbors clustering. This system aimed to provide personalized movie recommendations by analyzing user preferences and clustering similar users together. Key techniques employed in this project included:

1. **K-Neighbors Clustering**: This algorithm was used to group users with similar tastes, enhancing the accuracy of recommendations.
2. **Matrix Factorization**: To decompose the user-item interaction matrix, which helped in predicting missing entries and improving recommendation quality.
3. **Mean Squared Error (MSE) Loss**: This metric was used to measure the performance of the recommendation model, ensuring the minimization of prediction errors.
4. **Adam Optimizer**: Utilized for efficient optimization during the training process, allowing for faster convergence and better handling of sparse data.

The combination of these methodologies resulted in a robust movie recommendation system capable of delivering tailored suggestions to users based on their individual preferences and behavior patterns.
