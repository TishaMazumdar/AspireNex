# AI Tasks | AspireNex

This repository contains two AI projects I completed as part of my application for an Artificial Intelligence internship at AspireNex.

## Overview

### Project 1: AI Tic-Tac-Toe
An unbeatable Tic-Tac-Toe game where players can choose:
- **X-Player**: Human, Dumb Computer, Smart Computer
- **O-Player**: Human, Dumb Computer, Smart Computer

The smart computer uses the minimax algorithm, ensuring it never loses, with the best outcome for a player being a tie.

### Project 2: Movie Recommendation System
A movie recommendation system using collaborative filtering techniques, including:
- **K-Means Clustering**: Groups users with similar preferences.
- **Matrix Factorization**: Predicts missing entries in the user-item interaction matrix.
- **Performance Metrics**: Utilizes Mean Squared Error (MSE) Loss and Adam Optimizer.

## About Me
As a diligent BTech Computer Science and Engineering student, I am passionate about exploring artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). Proficient in Python, I infuse creativity and critical thinking into my projects, drawing inspiration from the evocative nature of poetry. My current academic pursuits revolve around delving into the intricacies of AI and ML, aiming to apply these technologies to solve real-world challenges across various domains. Motivated by a commitment to expanding problem-solving horizons, I aspire to utilize AI and ML techniques innovatively to impact society positively.
